	level making

Main:
	edit README
	Level selection screen

Optional:
	make a box that blocks water
	make jump relative to how long this space bar is pressed

Note:
	it is known that turning the outlet off while player is in contact with
		flowing water causes a crash, but the plan is to make player stunned
		while turning valves
	also downwards outlet doesn't freeze on impact even if the bottom water 
		is already frozen, but still, doesn't matter
